# Conceal-and-Reveal: Exploring Image Steganography and Steganalysis

Steganography is used to conceal information within plain sight, while Steganalysis is employed to reveal this information. You will hide messages within images, then utilize various techniques to detect and unveil the concealed content. Afterwards, you will train a machine learning model to classify images that contain hidden information.
