# Introduction

Steganography has various forms and uses whether it be as invisible ink messages or digital watermarks. Although it is often confused with cryptography, steganography doesn’t hide a message’s meaning but rather conceals that message’s existence. Steganalysis is then used to determine whether steganography has been used on content like an image and then to reveal the hidden message.

Our research consisted of using various techniques to implement steganography and steganalysis, and experimenting with cryptography to hide a message’s meaning. We created and ran various machine learning models using both convolutional neural networks (CNN), such as ResNet50 and EfficientNetV2‐S, and support vector machines (SVM) to detect the difference between images with and without steganography.
